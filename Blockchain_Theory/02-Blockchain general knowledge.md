# Blockchain General Knowledge

### Storage:

it's space to store data in decentralized network , the space is provided by users unused space on their hard disk.
In blockchain storage, files are first broken apart in a process called sharding. Each shard is copied to prevent loss of data should an error occur during transmission. The files are also encrypted with a private key that makes it impossible for it to be viewed by other nodes in the network. The replicated shards are distributed among decentralized nodes all over the world.

<strong>What is sharding?</strong><br/>
Sharding is a type of database partitioning that separates large databases into smaller, faster,...

Sia, InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), MaidSafe and Storj are some of the more prominent companies offering blockchain storage.

### IPFS:

content addressing:
a away to address data by it's hash rather than it's location(ip).

### Cryptography:

With symmetric cryptography, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. A sender and a recipient must already have a shared key that is known to both.

With asymmetric crypto, two different keys are used for encryption and decryption. Every user in an asymmetric cryptosystem has both a public key and a private key. The private key is kept secret at all times, but the public key may be freely distributed.

in the asymmetric anyone can encrypt a message with someone public key but only the one who has the private key of that public key can decrypt it. and it's also reverse to .

### What Is Consensus?

Consensus for blockchain is a procedure in which the peers of a blockchain network reach agreement about the present state of the data in the network. Through this, consensus algorithms establish reliability and trust in the blockchain network.

### Proof of Stake:

there is no compete between nodes or miners it's just who ever put more stake or coin it can be the one to sign the new block.

### Delegated Proof of Stake:

it base on voting so the users will vote and at the end the miner or block producers who get the must vote would validate the transaction and would get a reward , the reward would be shared between he and all those who vote him, the vote with more stake will have the more power.

### Benefits of Blockchain Interoperability:

1. Constomizable web3 services:
2. creating services than can’t be created in web2,
3. Blockchain interoperability may also eventually enable multi-token transactions and multi-token wallet systems,

4. A more decentralized ecosystem :
   there could one day be thousands of application-specific blockchains that communicate with one another through a decentralized main hub.

5. Enhanced cross-industry collaboration:
   different industry can exchange data with each other ,This means organizations and communities that wouldn’t typically interact with one another would be able to exchange information, leverage each other’s strengths, and cultivate innovation more effortlessly and effectively.

<strong>How Is Blockchain Interoperability Achieved?</strong>

Sidechains: sidechains are separate blockchain networks that are compatible with a single mainchain. Each sidechain has its own consensus mechanism, security parameters, and tokens

<strong>Oracles:</strong><br/>
Within the context of blockchain technology, oracles bridge the information gap between on-chain and off-chain environments.

<strong>Bridges and swaps:</strong><br/>
Cross-chain bridges enable a digital asset owned by a party to be locked on one chain while an identical asset is “minted” on another chain and sent to an address owned by the original owner
