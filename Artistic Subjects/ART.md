# ART

### Start with the basics

1. Title : Begin by mentioning the title of the artwork. The title can provide valuable context or insight into the artist's intentions or the subject matter.

2. Artist's name: State the name of the artist who created the artwork. This gives credit to the artist and allows readers to explore their other works if they're interested.

3. Texture and brushwork: If it's a painting or a sculpture, examine the surface and the artist's technique. Is the texture smooth, rough, or somewhere in between? Notice the brushstrokes, the layering of paint, or any visible marks left by the artist's hand.

4. Subject matter: Identify the central theme or subject depicted in the artwork. Is it a landscape, a portrait, an abstract composition, or something else entirely? Look for recognizable objects, figures, or symbols that convey meaning or narrative.

5. Style and influences: Consider the style of the artwork and any discernible influences the artist may have drawn from. Is it reminiscent of a specific art movement, such as Impressionism, Cubism, or Surrealism? Explore how the artist's unique style contributes to the overall impact.

6. Emotional response: Reflect on your personal emotional response to the artwork. Does it evoke a sense of tranquility, excitement, confusion, or introspection? Consider how the artwork's formal elements contribute to these emotional reactions.
