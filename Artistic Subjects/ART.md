### Start with the basics

1. Title : Begin by mentioning the title of the artwork. The title can provide valuable context or insight into the artist's intentions or the subject matter.

2. Artist's name: State the name of the artist who created the artwork. This gives credit to the artist and allows readers to explore their other works if they're interested.
