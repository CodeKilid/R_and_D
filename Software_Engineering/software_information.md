# Software engineering

## -Demand engineering

## -Choosing a model

## -Two main parts:

1. management side of software production
2. technical side of software production

## -Problems in the production of software:

1.  changing to fast
2.  progress is not watchable
3.  new expectations
4.  hidden payment
5.  frozen employee
6.  unstable employee
7.  wrong believes

## -Long term stratgy:

1.  contracts payments
2.  technical field and place of work
3.  reusable
4.  quality of product and supporting the product for the long term

## -How to choose a project:

1.  specific contact
2.  specific job -> should be clear
3.  clear conditions
4.  the ability to do
5.  main value
6.  Along the long-term goals
7.  Official agreement

## -Managing the human resource and knowledge:

1.  teams:

    1. kind of project
    2. clearing the tasks
    3. multiple rules for a person
    4. wrong task for the wrong person

2.  clarifying meetings:

    1. bad understanding -> big problem
    2. educating for taking responsibility

3.  workplace:

    1. physical
    2. mental
    3. remote

4.  tools: 1. different tools for different jobs 2. more efficiency 3. For more harmony 4. Easier integration 5. Consistency in choosing tools

5.  education for employees:

    1. technical
    2. environment knowledge

6.  brainstorm

7.  progress of knowledge management:
    1. Identification and determination of knowledge
    2. Gaining knowledge
    3. Developing knowledge
    4. Knowledge distribution/sharing
    5. Use of knowledge
    6. Knowledge Maintenance
    7. Goels of knowledge
    8. Evaluation of knowledge

## -Plannign and scheduling:

1. planning:

   1. goals
   2. analyzing resources
   3. determining duties
   4. Allocation of the tasks

2. timing:
   1. real-time gain after completeness of the project
   2. determine a time for each task
   3. Arrangement of tasks and scheduling
   4. The effect of resource limitations
   5. Pessimistic timing (not optimistic)
   6. Specification and design time = twice the coding time
   7. Time for corrections = double coding
   8. gant

## -Risk management:

1. detemining the risk

2. analyzing the risk
   1. type
   2. section or element of risk creation
   3. other elements that can get involved
   4. limitation of time
   5. quality and level
3. arrangement the risks

4. controlling the risk

   1. planning
   2. surveillance of risk

5. way of managing risk:
   1. best time for solving the risk
   2. most important tool for reducing the risk
   3. controlling the quality of the product
   4. employees satisfaction
   5. hidden risks
   6. choosing people

## -Documentation:

1. proper tools
2. specific patterns
3. organized storage
4. on-time creation
5. reusable
6. simple
7. clear
8. short

## -Pricing:

1. with the algorithm
2. Expert judgment
3. Estimation by similarity
4. Hyperparkinson method
5. Razor cut!
6. Up-down estimation
7. Bottom-up estimation
8. With the help of software
9. With the help of estimating companies

## -Demands:

1. what should the product do?
2. on what condition should it work?
3. what is the benefit for others and us?
4. ....

## -Analyze:

1. what are we analyzing?
2. what do we want to know?
3. for analysis:
   1. understand the goals
   2. separate the problems
   3. gather information
   4. looking for relations
   5. summary

## -Objects:

I think the solid is enough

## -Model and modeling

choose a model for development

## -Designing user interfaces :

UI & UX

## -Implementing

## -Testing:

1. management
2. technical
3. alpha/ beta faze
4. coverage

## -Maintenance:

1. good structure
2. understandable
3. good documentation

## -Having a definition for ending
